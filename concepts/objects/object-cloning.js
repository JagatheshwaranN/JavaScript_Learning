// There are two types of cloning:
// Shallow Copy: This copies only the first level of properties. Nested objects
// still reference the original ones.
// Deep Copy: This creates a completely new object with no references to the
// original object, including nested objects.

// Shallow Copy
// It can be done using Object.assign() or Spread Operator(...).

// NOTE: When you make a shallow copy (whether using Object.assign() or the spread 
// operator ...), the top-level properties (primitive types like strings, numbers, 
// and booleans) are copied directly. However, nested objects (like arrays or other 
// objects) are not deeply copiedâ€”they are still referenced.

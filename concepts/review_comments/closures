Coming to your explanation—this is a really good understanding of Closures! 🔥👏
You’ve covered:
✅ Function inside a function
✅ Access to outer function variables (Lexical Environment)
✅ Preserving data even after outer function execution
✅ Use cases like encapsulation & private variables

Just one small clarification:
=============================
"Closures don’t create a copy of variables; they keep a reference to them."
This means if the variable changes later, the closure will reflect that change.

Your understanding is great, but there's one small mistake in your code:
function greeting() {
    let name = "Jaga";
    return function displayName() {
        console.log(`Hello! ${name}`);
    }
}
greeting();

You called greeting();, but you didn't store or invoke the inner function.

function greeting() {
    let name = "Jaga"; // Outer function variable
    return function displayName() { // Inner function (Closure)
        console.log(`Hello! ${name}`); // Accessing outer variable
    }
}
const greet = greeting(); // `greeting()` returns `displayName` function
greet(); // Now calling the returned function

Explanation:
1️⃣ greeting() runs and creates a Lexical Scope with name = "Jaga".
2️⃣ It returns the displayName function, which still remembers name.
3️⃣ We store it in greet.
4️⃣ When we call greet(), it still has access to name, even though greeting() has 
finished execution.

🚀 Real-World Application of Closures
Closures are super useful in real-world scenarios, like:
✅ Data Encapsulation & Private Variables
✅ Event Handlers & Callbacks
✅ Maintaining State in Functional Programming
✅ Creating Singleton Patterns in JavaScript
